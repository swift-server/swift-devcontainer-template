This template uses the common-utils feature to implement some commonly implemented options including install zsh and updating packages. Edit the values in the `devcontainer.json` to enable these. More details on available options can be found [here](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/blob/main/src/common-utils/README.md). 

### Adding the definition to a project or codespace

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please see getting started information on [setting up](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) Dev Containers or [creating a codespace](https://aka.ms/ghcs-open-codespace) using GitHub Codespaces.

2. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.

3. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Add Dev Container Configuration Files...** command for **Dev Containers** or **Codespaces**.

   > **Note:** If needed, you can drag-and-drop the `.devcontainer` folder from this sub-folder in a locally cloned copy of this repository into the VS Code file explorer instead of using the command.

4. Select this definition. You may also need to select **Show All Definitions...** for it to appear.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** to start using the definition.
